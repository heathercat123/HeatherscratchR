1. Install XAMPP 1.7.7:
	You can get it from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Windows/1.7.7/xampp-win32-1.7.7-VC9-installer.exe/download
	In the installer, just press next until it's done

2. Get ScratchR:
	- Install GIT from https://git-scm.com/
	- Rename C:\XAMPP\htdocs\ to C:\XAMPP\htdocs.bak\
	- Create a new folder called "htdocs"
	- If you want normal ScratchR: Run "git svn clone https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/scratchr/" from that folder
	- If you want HeatherscratchR: Run "git clone https://github.com/heathercat123/HeatherscratchR.git scratchr" from that folder
	In the next steps, if I mention anything under \app, it's inside C:\XAMPP\htdocs\scratchr\app

3. Get and run memcached:
	- Download memcached-windows from https://github.com/jefyt/memcached-windows/releases/latest
	- Extract it then run "memcached -d"

4. Get and enable php_pecl_memcache:
	- Download the 5.3 Tread Safe version from https://pecl.php.net/package/memcache/3.0.8/windows
	- Extract it and copy php_memcache.dll to C:\XAMPP\PHP\EXT\
	- Add this to C:\XAMPP\PHP\php.ini, below [PECL]:
		extension=php_memcache.dll

5. Get eAccelerator:
	- Download eAccelerator
	- Compile in TS mode on Visual Studio 2008 with the PHP 5.3.8 sources
	- Replace C:\XAMPP\php\ext\php_eaccelerator_ts.dll with the newly compled file
	- Search for "eaccelerator" in C:\XAMPP\PHP\PHP.ini then uncomment the line

6. Create the database:
	- Open up the XAMPP control panel located in C:\xampp\xampp-control.exe if the installer didn't do it for you already
	- Start MySQL
	- Open up mysql (stored in C:\XAMPP\mysql\bin) with the arguments "mysql -u root"
	- Run "CREATE DATABASE scratchr;"
		You can replace "scratchr" by anything you want, it'll be the name of the database
	- You can now exit by running "exit;"

7. Set up the database using step 4 of INSTALL.txt, just discard the -p and note that name_of_database is the same as above (scratchr).
	To get the updates in the right order, you have to separate them by year in different folders then sort them by name.
	Also, ignore any duplicates errors

8. Set up the database access info:
	- Copy \app\config\database.php.default to \app\config\database.php
	- Fill out the database access info
		By default, on XAMPP, the login is "root" and the password is empty
		For the database name, set it to, well, the database name (scratchr)
		Don't change anything else than "login", "password" and "database" unless you know what you're doing!
		Basically, it should look like this:
			'driver' => 'mysql',
			'persistent' => false,
			'host' => 'localhost',
			'login' => 'root',
			'password' => '',
			'database' => 'scratchr',
			'prefix' => '',
		Also, you only need to set the '$default' database

9. Set the memcache server to localhost:
	- Search for "MEMCACHE_SERVER" in \app\config\bootstrap.php
	- Replace 'scratchdb.media.mit.edu' by 'localhost'

10. Clear /app/tmp:
		- If it exists, delete it
		- Create a new empty \app\tmp

11. Configure Apache to point to \app\webroot:
		- Open C:\XAMPP\APACHE\CONF\httpd.conf in a text editor
		- Search for "DocumentRoot"
		- Replace "C:/xampp/htdocs" by "C:/xampp/htdocs/scratchr/app/webroot"

12. Set up a VirtualHost:
	- Open C:\XAMPP\APACHE\CONF\EXTRA\httpd-vhosts.conf in a text editor
	- Add this at the end:
<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1>
	ServerName scratch.local
	ServerAlias www.scratch.local
	DocumentRoot C:/xampp/htdocs/scratchr/app/webroot/
		<Directory />
				Options FollowSymLinks
				AllowOverride All
			RewriteEngine   On
			Options -Multiviews  FollowSymLinks
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
		RewriteRule ^static/projects/.+/([0-9]+)_(sm|med).png$ static/icons/project/default_$2.jpg [QSA,L]

		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
		RewriteRule ^static/projects/.+/([0-9]+).sb$ static/misc/default.sb [QSA,L]

		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
		RewriteRule ^static/icons/gallery/(.*)$ static/icons/gallery/default.jpg [QSA,L]

		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
		RewriteRule ^static/icons/buddy/([0-9]*)_(sm|med).jpg$ static/icons/buddy/default_$2.jpg [QSA,L]

		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
		RewriteRule ^static/icons/buddy/([0-9]*)_(sm|med).png$ static/icons/buddy/default_$2.jpg [QSA,L]

		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
		RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?url=$1 [QSA,L]
		RewriteRule .*\.svn/.* - [F]
	</Directory>
</VirtualHost>

13. Go back to your XAMPP Control Panel from step 6 and start Apache

14. Open a web browser and go to http://localhost/
		If you can see the Scratch homepage, skip to step 15
		If you, however, see a blank page with text, it's debugging time!
			- If you get "OMG. Scratch could not connect to memcached", make sure php_memcache is enabled in php.ini and that memcached is running. More info at step 3 and 4.
			- If you don't have any OMG errors, try to:
				- Go into C:\XAMPP\PHP\ in the Command Prompt then run PHP --version. If there's an eAccelerator error, make sure you compiled eAccelerator correctly
				- If you don't get any errors from php, try setting up the database again. More info at step 7.

15. You might be excited to see the Scratch homepage, but we're not quite done yet.
    There's a "Strict Standards" error on the of every page! Let's fix it:
		- Open up C:\XAMPP\HTDOCS\scratchr\cake\bootstrap.php in a text editor
		- Right after the first "if", add this line:
			error_reporting(E_ERROR);

16. Reload the page. The error should be gone, but we're still not done yet!
		- Sign up for an account and then log in
		- Now, set your pfp to anything other than "scratch code". That's not what I remember the Scratch 1.4 default pfp looking like!
		- Get an "Can't move upload file to new location" error
	We have to fix that.
		- Rename \app\webroot\static\rename2icons to icons
		- Check that the default pfp works
		- Try to set your pfp again
		- Check that it works

17. Add the 404 image:
		- If you're on HeatherscratchR, you can skip to step 18
		- Download the image from here: https://web.archive.org/web/20121106052142im_/http://scratch.mit.edu/img/404.png
		- Save it as /app/webroot/img/404.png
		- Go to any unexistant page and enjoy the image by DavidTy

18. Set yourself as admin:
		- Open MySQL again, but this time with the arguments mysql -u root scratchr
		- Run this command:
			UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE username = 'Heathercat123';
		You have to replace Heathercat123 by your username
		- Log out then log back in

You can now enjoy the admin-specific stuff, such as http://localhost/administration/
If you want to manipulate the database further, open http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ and avoid breaking everything!
To upload projects, go to http://localhost/services/share_project

Everything included in stock ScratchR + the 404 image should now work.
If you want anything that's not included in stock ScratchR, check out HeatherscratchR: https://github.com/Heathercat123/HeatherscratchR

Scratch On!
