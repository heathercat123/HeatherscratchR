# HeatherscratchR
Source code for the Scratch 1.4 section of Heatherscratch. This is based on ScratchR by LLK.
It doesn't include the Scratch Forums, the Text-Based Games Forums or the Scratch Wiki. How to get them will be added to INSTALL.txt one day or another.

Differences over the original ScratchR:
- Parts of the [Scratch Documentation Site](https://web.archive.org/web/20110411054144/http://info.scratch.mit.edu/) were added
- The Wiki icon was added
- The Scratch Suggestions icon was added

Better installation instructions are comming soon (at least i hope)!
