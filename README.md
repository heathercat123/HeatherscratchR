# HeatherscratchR
Source code for the Scratch 1.4 section of Heatherscratch. This is based on ScratchR by LLK.

It doesn't include the Scratch Forums, the Text-Based Games Forums, the Scratch Wiki, the stats site or any 2.0-styled page, including the 2.0 Wiki. How to get them will be added to the install guide one day or another.

Differences over the original ScratchR:
- Parts of the [Scratch Documentation Site](https://web.archive.org/web/20110411054144/http://info.scratch.mit.edu/) were added
- The Scratch 1.4 Downloads Page was added
- The early Scratch 2.0 maintenance page was added (Scratch 1.4 had no maintenance page)
- The Halloween 2009 logo was added
- The Wiki icon was added
- The Scratch Suggestions icon was added

For an exact list of modified file, see [here](https://github.com/heathercat123/HeatherscratchR/compare/cd6146e..master).

## Installation
There are currently two installation guides. One is made by Andrés (andresmh), one is by me.
- [ScratchR Setup Guides guide](https://heathercat123.github.io/ScratchR-setup-guides/heatherscratchr/xampp/). It's the best one yet, use this one. It's still a WIP and the end was kind of rushed, but the guide mostly has images. You can contribute to it [here](https://github.com/heathercat123/ScratchR-setup-guides).
- [Incomplete guide by me](https://github.com/heathercat123/HeatherscratchR/blob/master/how%20to%20scratchr.txt). Used to be the best guide, but not anymore.
- [Old INSTALL.TXT by Andrés](https://github.com/heathercat123/HeatherscratchR/blob/master/INSTALL.txt). One step is mentionned in the guide above, but other than that, don't use this guide.

For now, the installation instructions don't include how to get the forums, the tbg forums, the wiki or the stats.
