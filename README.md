# HeatherscratchR
Source code for the Scratch 1.4 section of Heatherscratch. This is based on ScratchR by LLK.

It doesn't include the Scratch Forums, the Text-Based Games Forums or the Scratch Wiki. How to get them will be added to INSTALL.txt one day or another.

Differences over the original ScratchR:
- Parts of the [Scratch Documentation Site](https://web.archive.org/web/20110411054144/http://info.scratch.mit.edu/) were added
- The Scratch 1.4 Downloads Page was added
- The early Scratch 2.0 maintenance page was added (Scratch 1.4 had no maintenance page)
- The Halloween 2009 logo was added
- The Wiki icon was added
- The Scratch Suggestions icon was added

For an exact list of modified file, see [here](https://github.com/heathercat123/HeatherscratchR/compare/cd6146e..master).

Better installation instructions are coming soon (at least I hope)!
