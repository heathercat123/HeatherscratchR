# HeatherscratchR
Source code for the Scratch 1.4 section of Heatherscratch. This is based on ScratchR by LLK.

It doesn't include the Scratch Forums, the Text-Based Games Forums, the Scratch Wiki or the stats site. How to get them will be added to the install guide one day or another.

Differences over the original ScratchR:
- Parts of the [Scratch Documentation Site](https://web.archive.org/web/20110411054144/http://info.scratch.mit.edu/) were added
- The Scratch 1.4 Downloads Page was added
- The early Scratch 2.0 maintenance page was added (Scratch 1.4 had no maintenance page)
- The Halloween 2009 logo was added
- The Wiki icon was added
- The Scratch Suggestions icon was added

For an exact list of modified file, see [here](https://github.com/heathercat123/HeatherscratchR/compare/cd6146e..master).

## Installation
There are currently two installation guides. One is made by Andrés (andresmh), one is by me.
- [WIP new guide by me](https://github.com/heathercat123/HeatherscratchR/blob/master/how%20to%20scratchr.txt). Use this one!
- [Old INSTALL.TXT by Andrés](https://github.com/heathercat123/HeatherscratchR/blob/master/INSTALL.txt). One step is mentionned in the new guide, but other than that, don't use this guide!

For now, the installation instructions don't include how to get the forums, the tbg forums, the wiki or the stats.
